# Commodity Supply Chain Pipeline

An end-to-end data engineering pipeline that ingests live commodity and 
shipping data, applies Medallion Architecture transformations, and surfaces 
a supply chain stress signal dashboard showing 2-3 week leading indicators 
of price volatility.

## The Business Problem

Global supply chain stress doesn't appear overnight — the signals exist 
in public data days or weeks before prices move. When crude oil inventories 
drop while shipping costs rise simultaneously, that's an early warning of 
a supply squeeze. This pipeline captures and quantifies that signal daily, 
automatically.

## Data Sources

| Source | What it provides | Update frequency |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| [EIA API](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/) | US crude oil inventory levels | Daily |
| FRED PPIFIS (Shipping Cost Proxy) | Producer Price Index for Transportation & Warehousing — used as BDI proxy (direct BDI access requires paid Baltic Exchange subscription) | Monthly |
| [UN Comtrade](https://comtradeplus.un.org/) | India petroleum import volumes | Monthly |

## Medallion Architecture

- **Bronze** — Raw JSON responses stored as-is in AWS S3. No transformation. Full audit trail.
- **Silver** — Cleaned, typed, validated data in Parquet format. Nulls removed, columns standardized.
- **Gold** — Aggregated analytical layer. Rolling averages, correlations, and the composite stress score.

## The Stress Signal

stress_score = (BDI_7day_change%) - (EIA_inventory_7day_change%)

A rising stress score indicates shipping demand is increasing while oil 
buffers are shrinking — historically a leading indicator of supply chain 
pressure 2-3 weeks ahead.

| Layer | Tool |
|-------|------|
| Ingestion | Python, `requests` |
| Storage | AWS S3 |
| Transformation | dbt + DuckDB |
